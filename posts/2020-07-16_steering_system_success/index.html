        <p>Today we successfully completed a working prototype of the steering system. The
system is build from a windscreen wiper motor and a strip of aluminium to mount
to the steering shaft.</p>
<p><img src="turn_left.gif" alt="Steering turning left"></p>
<p><img src="turn_right.gif" alt="Steering turning right"></p>
<p>Currently the motor is being powered with 12V from a car battery. Both the wiper
motor and the car battery were bought at a local wreckers.</p>
<p>This design is the third iteration of prototypes for a steering system.
Initially, a servo system was trialled (see <a href="/posts/2020-07-04_steering_system_attempt_1/">Steering System Attempt 1</a>) but this system was too weak. We also tested using a bike sprocket attached to the shaft driven by various motors (including a washing machine motor - see below) but we still could not produce enough power to turn the kart.</p>

<p><img src="washing_machine_motor_test.jpg" alt="Testing washing machine motor"></p>
<p>Another design being worked on in parallel with the wiper motor was a 3D printed gearbox, to be driven by a smaller DC motor. This design is yet to be tested:</p>

<p>Now that we have electronic controls for all three major systems (brakes, throttle &amp; steering), work will begin on designing electronics to control these systems as well as some software development.</p>
