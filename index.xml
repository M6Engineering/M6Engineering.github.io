      <description>We have embarked on the journey! After purchasing a go kart fitted with a KT100 from the staff at Brew Dog, we have started work fitting servos to allow for remote operation.
The first step is converting the current kart into something we can control remotely. We will then utilise this as a base for the self driving platform.</description>
